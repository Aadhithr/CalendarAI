# Welcome to Calendar AI

Calendar app with a touch of AI

Test with: https://calendar-ai-eta.vercel.app/

or in the project directory, you can run: npm start

The app allows you to operate the app similar to a normal calendar with adding events, start date, end date, description, priority level. 
Additionally AI is used to analyze your schedule and provide you with the best placement to add a certain event you would like to do. 

You can enter an event that you want to do with a few contraints, and it will tell you where it will fit best in your scheudle based on the events in your schedule.
